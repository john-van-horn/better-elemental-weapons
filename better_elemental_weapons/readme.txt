Better Elemental Weapons - Tested on Cemu 1.15.2 - 1.15.4 as a graphic pack [05/28/2019]

[Mod by FireFlyer24, on Gamebanana]

THIS WILL WORK WITH ALL OF MY OTHER MODS - YAYYY

Installation instructions:

1. Open your cemu folder, navigate to cemu/graphicPacks. Place the better_elemental_weapons folder inside your mod folder or just make a new folder inside cemu/graphicPacks called "Mods".

2. Open Cemu, go to options and then graphic packs. Enable the graphic pack and let me know on gamebanana how it is!

3. That's it! Have fun and please say something on my post! https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/8463

Basically, I made it so that every time you swing it, you don't lose any "Chemical" energy as the game calls it. And you regenerate the max every second :)

Now this works with every elemental weapon. Stay tuned for elements being added to OTHER weapons!!
